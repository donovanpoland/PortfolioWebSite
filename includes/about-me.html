<p>
    Hi there! I'm Donovan, a creative web developer and dedicated student with a passion for solving problems 
    and building engaging digital experiences. I'm continually expanding my knowledge in programming, driven by 
    curiosity and a desire to learn. When I'm not coding or studying, you'll usually find me reading, writing, gaming, 
    experimenting with new tech, or spending quality time with my family, who are my biggest motivation. 
    I'm eager to begin my professional journey in the tech industry and would love to discuss potential opportunities. 
    Feel free to reach outâ€”let's connect!
